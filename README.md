# ðŸ’³ Credit Card Fraud Detection with PySpark

This project builds a machine learning model using PySpark to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. It tackles the common challenge of highly imbalanced datasets.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Financial fraud, especially credit card fraud, is a serious issue costing billions annually. This model classifies transactions as either **fraudulent** or **legitimate** using machine learning.

Key highlights:
- Built using PySpark
- Handles **imbalanced data** (fraudulent transactions ~0.36%)
- Includes preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction for future transactions
- **App built** using Flask (backend) and Gradio (frontend) for user-friendly interaction
